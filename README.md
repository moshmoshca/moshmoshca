- 👋 Hi, I’m Massiel and I'm a Graphic Designer from the Dominican Republic
- 👀 My interests change constantly but a common theme in them is the fact that I love to make stuff. I like to read, mainly fantasy, sci-fi, and stuff like that but I make sure to read about other things that I find interesting as well.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Front-End development. I've been trying for some time now but I feel like 2022 is my year.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in projects that can help me have a better undertanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- 📫 How to reach me: massiel.capellan@gmail.com
