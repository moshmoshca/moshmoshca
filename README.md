- 👋 Hi, my name is Massiel and I'm a Graphic Designer from the Dominican Republic
- 👀 I have a variety of interests. A common theme is that I love to make stuff. I enjoy reading about fantasy, sci-fi, and sometimes thrillers but I make sure to read about other things that I find interesting as well.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Front-End development and it's going great so far!.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in projects that can help me have a better undertanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
